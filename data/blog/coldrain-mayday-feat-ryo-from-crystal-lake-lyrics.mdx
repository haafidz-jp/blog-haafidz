## ROMAJI

take what you got and leave now  
you're wearing out your welcome  
no one here wants to see you, hear you  
think that you won from day one  
but soon the devil will come  
you know just why he wants you, don't you?  

you're crooked desire left us in disarray  
misguided, divided at the point of no return  
you started a fire, you're gonna watch it burn  
try to save yourself like you always do  

every bridge we build  
you think it's yours to burn it down just burn it down  
when everything is gone  
you'll wish you only heard us out, heard us out  
screaming MAYDAY  

act like you've only done good  
unfairly miss understood?  
play the victim it's so you, what's new?  
lie after lie after lie  
we all stopped counting the crimes  
you know why we can't trust you, don't you?  

you're crooked desire left us in disarray  
misguided, divided at the point of no return  
you started a fire, you're gonna watch it burn  
try to save yourself like you always do  

every bridge we build  
you think it's yours to burn it down just burn it down  
when everything is gone  
you'll wish you only heard us out, heard us out  

why don't you choke on yourself  
swallow the hate or just fucking go  
you set yourself the world on fire  
rising higher and higher  
but there's no where to run  
because all of the bridges burned  
all you are is a fucking monster a walking disaster  
you touch it you break it you kill it  
just like a cureless cancer  

every bridge we build  
you think it's yours to burn it down  
when everything is gone  
you'll wish you only heard us out, heard us out  

every bridge we build  
you think it's yours to burn it down just burn it down  
when everything is gone  
you'll wish you only heard us out, heard us out  
screaming MAYDAY
