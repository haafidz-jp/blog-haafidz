## ROMAJI

4AM in the morning  
Doushite nemurenai  
Konna Bad day "Bye bye black birds"  
Tsubuyaite mo kienai tsuyoi fuan  

For hours lately  
I've been crying for hours baby  
I wish you were here  

Kimi ga kureta All those little letters  
yomikaesu tabi ni The pain's gone  

Hitori ja nai  
'Cause we are perfect as four  
Hanarebanare de mo tsunagaru  
Believe in you  
Itsu mo soba ni kanjite iru kara  
Closer to me and a clover for you  
Kimi ni koun wo  

Shirami hajimeta sora  
Under the sky no kimi ga  
Nai tenaita ki gakari no silence  
Itami wo shizumete no bori yuku darling  

For hours lately  
Ive been thinking about you baby  
I wish you the best of luck  

Tomori sugoshita hibi no memories  
Omoi dasu tabi ni i smile  

You know you're not alone  
'Cause we are perfect as four  
Hanarebanare de mo tsunagaru  
You live in me  
You know you're not alone  
'Cause we are perfect as four  
Closer to me and a clover for you  
Kimi ni koun wo  

Hitori ja nai  
'Cause we are perfect as four  
Hanarebanare de mo tsunagaru  
Believe in you  
Itsumo soba ni kanjite irukara  
Closer to me and a clover for you  
Kimi ni koun wo  

You know you're not alone  
'Cause we are perfect as four  
Hanarebanare de mo tsunagaru  
You live in me  
Itsumo soba ni watashi ga irukara  
Closer to me and a clover for you  
Kimi ni koun wo
